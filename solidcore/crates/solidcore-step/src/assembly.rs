//! A B-rep assembled from loose faces, edges and vertices into the kernel-neutral record, schema
//! 4 ([`solidcore_record::brep`]), whatever file they were read from. A reader adds each vertex
//! ([`Assembly::add_vertex`]), each edge on its curve between two of them
//! ([`Assembly::add_edge`]) and each face on its surface with its bounds
//! ([`Assembly::add_face`]), then [`Assembly::finish`] makes the record: seams for faces that
//! wind around a periodic surface, frames turned so a round face's form covers it once, each
//! edge's label and NURBS form, every use's pcurve (closed forms where the geometry has them, the
//! kernel's [`Trims`] for the rest), outer loops and face sides checked against the pcurves,
//! tolerances raised to the gaps the geometry has, regions, and the canonical order.
//!
//! The STEP reader ([`crate::topology`]) is one such reader; it was where this was written, and
//! its notes and refusals still name a face by its file entity (`face #id`). Any other reader
//! gives each face an `origin` of its own to be named by.
//!
//! What a reader gives: curves and surfaces as record curves and surfaces, in millimetres and
//! radians; each edge's interval on its curve from min to max, its vertices at the interval's
//! start and end; each bound relative to the surface's natural normal (seen from that normal an
//! outer loop runs counter-clockwise), and whether the face's side is that normal.
